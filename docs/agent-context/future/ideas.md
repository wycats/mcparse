- **Declarative Atom Syntax**: The current `define_atom!` macro is powerful but verbose for simple cases like Whitespace or Identifiers. We should explore a declarative syntax that is concise (like regex) but still captures the necessary constraints for the lexer (e.g., `kind`, `highlight`).
- **Procedural Macro for `define_language!`**: As the DSL for defining languages grows (custom atoms, regex, literals, delimiters), the `macro_rules!` implementation is becoming complex and fragile. Switching to a procedural macro would allow for:
  - Better error messages (pointing to the exact span of the error).
  - More flexible syntax (not limited by `macro_rules!` matchers).
  - Easier maintenance of the parsing logic.
  - Better IDE support (potentially).
- [ ] **VariableRules Context**: Give `VariableRules` access to the delimiter stack or more context to handle patterns like `let (a, b)`. Currently it only sees the previous token.
